#Markov Chain Generator
This project provides a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) data structure to be incorporated into other projects.

An example implementation of this data structure can be found here: [NY-Times-Headline-Generator/Markov](https://github.com/sjsimps/NY-Times-Headline-Generator/tree/master/Markov)
